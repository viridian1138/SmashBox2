 SmashBox2 (Full Body Track) VR


SmashBox2 is a full body track (both hands and feet) Virtual Reality (VR) martial arts exercise program using PyOpenVR, PyOpenGL, and PyGame.   Requires Python 3, an OpenVR headset with full body trackers, and one of the better modern graphics cards.  Execute using the script  "exec_SmashBox2_VR.py"

This is a draft version.

SmashBox2 is based on SmashBox (  https://viridian1138.github.io/SmashBox/index.html ), but provides full body tracking which SmashBox lacked.  Also, SmashBox2 ports the original SmashBox from JavaScript to Python and changes the API from Three.JS to PyOpenVR..
